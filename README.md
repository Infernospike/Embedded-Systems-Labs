# Embedded Systems Labs (ECE 4724)

Welcome to the repository for the Embedded Systems labs at Mississippi State University. This course, ECE 4724, covers advanced topics in embedded systems design, utilizing contemporary practices to address real-world challenges.

This repository contains all the laboratory works and projects I have completed as part of this course. Each lab is organized into a specific folder containing the design files and final outputs, showcasing the application of embedded systems theory to practical design tasks.
